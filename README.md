## Getting Started

The following guide has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

You will need to have git installed (we hope you already do):
```
sudo apt install git
```

Follow the yarn install guide.

You might not have curl installed. Get it with:
```
sudo apt install curl
```

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ionhoria/wouso-frontend.git
```

Run yarn and start the development server:
```
yarn
yarn start
```

Great job! You are now up and running and ready to contribute to WoUSO.
